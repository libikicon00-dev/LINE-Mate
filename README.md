📂 Source Code Availability

Because the project contains native Android build files generated by React Native, Git is currently rejecting some very long file paths on Windows.
➡️ This makes the full source code temporarily unable to upload directly to GitHub until the project is cleaned and restructured.

📌 For now, please view the full working project source code here:
👉 Google Drive (Public Link):
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aK9gKlYB69ncHg6XF0cuAiWlUiC4-Jj5

> The GitHub repository will be updated once the file structure is fully optimized and build artifacts are removed.
